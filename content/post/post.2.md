While statistics is an exact science, emotions by contrast are subjective, often irrational and difficult 
to measure. Despite or perhaps even due to this contrast, statistics and emotions are increasingly 
considered together: **if moods and feelings increasingly define what is true and false, what exactly is 
the role of statistics**? 

- Are decisions too often made on a purely emotional basis, neglecting statistical  data  and  proven  facts?  

- How  important  are  evidence-based  decision  processes  given  that  factual correctness is becoming less and less relevant in politics and the economy? 

- How do statisticians deal  with  “fake  news”?  What  emotions  do  surveys  or  statistical  results  trigger  among  the  public?  

- What biases and resentments exist compared with fact-based statistics?

In the course of these three days, well-known figures from the field of statistics, the economy, academia, politics and culture will specifically discuss these issues. A number of open workshops will 
offer the opportunity to exchange views on a wide selection of topics.
